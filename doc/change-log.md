> Due to the nature of this theme being primarily vertical-tab focused, the **tabs on top** layout - may have some quirks. Though it behaves just as default-firefox behavior, please let me know if you spot anything that seems *off*.

> FF Ultima is reaching it's maturity, additional updates to the theme will most likely only focus on bugs, patches, and fine-tuning. If you'd like to see more features added to the list, feel free to fork or push via pull request. Contributors, like always - are always welcome. Otherwise, enjoy.
