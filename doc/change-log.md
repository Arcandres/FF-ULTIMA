- [Sidebery configuration](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/blob/main/theme/%23sideberyultimastyling.json) for users who want to opt out of the native vertical tabs (simply import into your sidebery settings), turn off `ultima.tabs.vertical` in `about:config`, works with autohiding the sidebar:
