<details>
<summary>Initial Setup</summary>

###### üõà This is mostly for first time Installation: üõà

- [x] If your Profile Folder does not have a `chrome` folder, create one.
- [x] If your Profile Folder already has a `chrome` folder, empty it.
- [x] The theme will automatically enable userChrome stylesheets via user.js.
- [x] Please have Firefox's System-Theme enabled. You can change this later.

###### ‚¨áÔ∏è Choose *one* of the installation methods below. ‚¨áÔ∏è

<details><summary>The Easy Way</summary>

###### üõà Autoconfig Users should download the Source instead of the release Zip üõà

1. Download the latest version on the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest).
2. Copy everything in the ffultima.zip into your `chrome` folder.
3. For first time installation, you need to apply the `user.js` to firefox to access the theme settings.
4. In the chrome folder, youll see the `user.js`, move it <ins>out the chrome folder and into the Profile Folder<ins>.
5. Restart Firefox.
6. <ins>**Wait** for Firefox to open</ins>, then delete the `user.js` file.
7. Go to `about:config` and search for `ultima` to see all of your settings. You should also see:

<details><summary>The Hard Way</summary>
 
###### üõà This method involves using Git and the Terminal - allowing easier updates. Harder for the less technical of people. üõà
- This method automates every step of the "Easy Way" Installation.
- Replace *`YourProfileFolder`* with the name of your Profile Folder.
- Only use the *`# restart firefox`* line, for the Firefox Browser that you are using.
- This method assumes (in *`# CLEANUP USER.JS`*) that your Firefox Browser can restart in 5 seconds.

> üõà What that Code do? These codeblocks can be copy/pasted/entered in one go. It navigates to your Firefox Profile Folder... Downloads the theme into a chrome folder via Git... Then copies the user.js found inside to your Profile Folder... It then restarts Firefox and removes the user.js... It waits for running commands to finish before moving on to the next. Fully automating the Installation Process.
