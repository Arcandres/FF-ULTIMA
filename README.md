> userChrome Themes work by communicating with a chrome folder located in your Firefox Profile folder, think of it as your User Interface. This folder typically holds `.css` files with the purpose of customizing elements of the Browser. There are two easy ways to access this folder:

1. Go to the `about:support` page
- In the URL Bar, type `about:support`.
- Look for the **Profile Folder** row. Open the folder.
- In that folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (If it doesnt already exist).

2. Go to the `about:profiles` page
- In the URL Bar, type `about:profiles`.
- Your profile will say `This is the profile in use and...`.
- Look for the **Root Directory** row, and click **Open Directory**.
- In the opened Folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (if it doesnt already exist).
