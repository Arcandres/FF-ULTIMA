##### (3/22/24) Linking the Modification page once more, this theme has a lot of potential for the community.
##### I wanted to keep this relatively simple/lightweight, so others can pick/choose what they want, and add whatever they please later on. Anyway..
##### Having the sidebar free to use is a BIG thing, hopefully I can further improve the native tabs in the future. I've only been doing this CSS stuff about two months, Javascript for about a month, so we'll see.
##### If anyone out there has good experience with CSS flexboxs, feel free to fork/recreate this theme, Ive managed to get the tabs free flowing but some more can be done.
##### Custom Variables (--uc-ultima-etc) are used to target everything effected. Seperated and organized in a `global-theme` and `global-positioning` file.
##### Anyone that likes to design color schemes, it is supported using these variables in Live Debugger.
