###### üõà This is mostly for first time Installation: üõà

- [x] If your Profile Folder does not have a `chrome` folder, create one.
- [x] If your Profile Folder already has a `chrome` folder, empty it.
- [x] The theme will automatically enable userChrome stylesheets via user.js.
- [x] Please have Firefox's System-Theme enabled. You can change this later.

###### ‚¨áÔ∏è Choose *one* of the installation methods below. ‚¨áÔ∏è

<details><summary>The Easy Way</summary>

###### üõà Autoconfig Users should download the Source instead of the release Zip üõà

1. Download the latest version on the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest).
2. Copy everything in the ffultima.zip into your `chrome` folder.
3. For first time installation, you need to apply the `user.js` to firefox to access the theme settings.
4. In the chrome folder, youll see the `user.js`, move it <ins>out the chrome folder and into the Profile Folder<ins>.
5. Restart Firefox.
6. <ins>**Wait** for Firefox to open</ins>, then delete the `user.js` file.
</details>

<details><summary>The Hard Way</summary>

>
For this method, all you need is Git and a Terminal. It's harder for the less technical of people, but truth be told, this is the real "Easy Way".. I made a tool called [gituserChrome](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome), it fully automates the Installation Process of any userChrome theme, handling user.js, restarts, backing up existing chrome, etc.. By pasting one command (with the source of the theme attached) in terminal, you can fully install and update FF Ultima.
- To Install FF Ultima - copy/paste the command for your operating system.
###### LINUX ([BASH SCRIPT](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome)):
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome/main/gituserChrome.sh)
```

###### WINDOWS ([POWERSHELL SCRIPT](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome)):
```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome/main/gituserChrome.ps1')"
```

###### MAC ([COPY LINUX](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome))
