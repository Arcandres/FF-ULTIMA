###### ← chrome/themes/position-verttab.css

- remove verticle tabs for sidebery/sidebar uses instead<br>
- ← download your new file from the list, and replace the old
- this deletes the verticle tabs and allows users to use the sidebar `sidebery/treestyletabs` in its place
- this adds autohiding to the sidebar, and light styling to center the header
- `users are responsible for handling styling of the sidebar, since this is not a default feature of the theme`
