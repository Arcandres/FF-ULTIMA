## Create a theme. I was able to create Dusky, just like this.
###### You atleast need to have knowledge on what live debugging is, to proceed.
###### chrome/theme/all-global-theme-dusky.css
- Make a copy of `all-global-theme-dusky.css`, for a light color scheme
- And/Or a copy of `all-global-theme-fullmoon.css`, for a dark color scheme
- Name your theme file `all-global-theme-dracula.css` ( just an example :/ )
- In userChrome, rename the theme file above with the one you just created
- Open up Live Debugger `ctrl+shift+alt+I`
- Type `--uc-ultima-window` on the right side searchbar for css properties
- Here you will find the full list of all theming variables used
- Start tinkering.
- You can create your theme live and see how the windows, colors, all look
- Find color combinations that you like, copy them into your custom theme file
- Congrats.

- Note: The variable `--uc-ultima-window` is only active for [ Dusky ] not for [ Full Moon ]
- to change window-color in dark themes add this line to the list of variables:
- `--toolbar-bgcolor: var(--uc-ultima-window);`, my variables will ensure the rest of the body, backgrounds, etc, match your desired color.

### /theme/function-mini-button-bar.css (Outdated line #'s, however the variables are still in the respected file)

- for deletion, you can just drag all buttons out and it will be gone
- Color of Bar on customize-toolbar page, line 12, defaults black in `Full Moon`, yellow in `Dusky`
- the following buttons work for the button bar, NO EXTENSIONS:
![mini button bar](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/assets/155501797/c0322340-9c81-47f3-bdda-44bd520cb14a)
- you can adjust when the buttons dissappear, line 93
- 15 buttons are allowed, you can edit the file to increase this number, and size them based on view height
- you can get creative and use the vertical tabs window ONLY for buttons
  - first, target tabs `.tabbrowser-tab{opacity: 0 !important;}`
  - then, remove mouse events `.tabbrowser-tab{pointer-events: none !important;}`
  - then, increase the number of buttons in the mini-button-bar.css file
  - and use sidebery or treestyle tabs for your tabs instead
  - you can use the S(40px tabs) Version of the theme, and the button bar will already be positioned to sit inside of the unused tabs space.
