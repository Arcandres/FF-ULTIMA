> Color Schemes can rely on a simple `user.theme.default` format, which would then handle both dark mode `full moon (default)` and light mode `dusky (default)`. One file to manage both. Managing add on themes, color modes, becomes a lot easier. Number of files in the source would then be reduced by 3. Simplifying this makes transparency `user.theme.transparent` easier to implement as well. And other color schemes (like `user.theme.gruvbox`) can have both dark/light managed in the same place.
