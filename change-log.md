### <ins> Version Notes
- `Firefox 137 delivers ExpandOnHover Auto-hiding!` *And most* of FF Ultima's source went through edit to work for FF 137.
- Theme settings, like tab auto-hiding and tab width, are no longer needed. Other tab related settings have been adjusted to work with firefox's Vertical Tab ExpandOnHover. Changes are reflected in the user.js list.
- :warning: There is a bug where the second sidebar will sometimes [glitch out of position](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-sidebar-and-vertical-tabs-try-them-out-in-nightly/m-p/87361/highlight/true#M33460) when you hover the verttabs (when both are visible). This is a Firefox issue, not caused by the theme. They are aware of it.
- I've brought some issues and recommendations to the attention and acknowledgement of Mozilla Staff via the original Vertical Tabs Announcement thread on Mozilla:
   - [Recommended styling of the sidebar views](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-sidebar-and-vertical-tabs-try-them-out-in-nightly/m-p/87361/highlight/true#M33460)
   - [Keeping the Verttabs expanded even when the context menu (right click menu) is triggered](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-sidebar-and-vertical-tabs-try-them-out-in-nightly/m-p/87360/highlight/true#M33459)
- Firefox 137+ required.
- User.js required.

### <ins> Change Log:
- `info` Vertical Tab autohiding is now just Firefox's native ExpandOnHover with some adjustment, this can be enabled/disabled in Sidebar Settings. You can also now change the size (width) of the vertical tabs by dragging it with your mouse to a desired width.
- `new` Setting `ultima.xstyle.tabgroups.with.colormix` Tab group styles are fully restore and this setting will add the group-colored background like before.
- `new` Setting `ultima.xstyle.pinnedtabs.i` when using tab autohiding the pinned tabs will be listed vertically.
- `qol` Undoing some privacy preferences that were previously altered by the theme back to their default values, these should left to be dealt with by the user. [ea1711a](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/commit/ea1711a0eface7392e1ba3ce71bec1b2537988de)
- `fix` Media Playing Icon on tabs restored.
- `fix` New Tab buttons functionality restored.
- `wip` Autoconfig support restoration.
- *** Adaptive Color Scheme, Adjustments for adaptive tab extension compatibility.
