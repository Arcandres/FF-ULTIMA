### <ins> Change Log:
- `fyi ‚Ä¢ ‚ÑπÔ∏è ‚Ä¢ ` 
- `fix ‚Ä¢ üî¥ ‚Ä¢ `

- `new ‚Ä¢ üü¢ ‚Ä¢ ` 
- `qol ‚Ä¢ üü° ‚Ä¢ ` Ublock Origin extension panel automatically adjust to color scheme e1ddb8c
- `qol ‚Ä¢ üü° ‚Ä¢ ` Floating Url Bar optimization, max width & positioning adjustment for smaller windows to bigger (Ultrawide) windows d288238
- `wip ‚Ä¢ üü° ‚Ä¢ ` The current color scheme logic is a bit bloated; Reworking it to be more *simple* is a goal for the next release.

> Color Schemes can rely on a simple `user.theme.default` format (or user.theme.catpuccin-mocha). One file can manage both light & dark mode versions of the same theme (light-dark). Managing add on themes, color modes, becomes a lot easier. Number of files in the source would then be reduced by 3. Simplifying makes transparency easier to implement as well.
